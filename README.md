# Federated Discovery on the Web of Things
In a discovery service, users send a request to the system, asking for a service, and the discovery service, using the available information in the linked directory, returns the service that best suits the user's requirements. However, the information stored in the directory may not fulfill the user's requirements by asking a building about information stored in another location. As a result, the discovery service must be able to delegate the query to another system that may discover the service required. In the delegation process, the discovery service must implement a model that defines the delegation behavior, especially regarding the search process and communications security, among other considerations. As there is currently no federation proposal for the Web of Things (WoT), we propose a federated discovery model that supports supervised and non-supervised architectures in computing continuum environments. The proposed federation defines the delegation and search techniques for delegating queries between discovery services in a WoT architecture. After experimentation, the proposed model is validated by comparing the search process between a distributed federation and a centralized approach.
